# chembl-api

The goal of this project is to use the REST API Methods from ChEMBL to pull in compound, target, and assay data in JSON format and import them into a Graph Databse.

Our motivation is to use the flexixibility of a graph database, like Neo4j, to reduce duplications in the data while keeping a consistent structure.
